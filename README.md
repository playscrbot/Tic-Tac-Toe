- Paste the URL of this GitHub repository: `https://github.com/playscrbot/Tic-Tac-Toe`
- Click **"Import from GitHub"** again to create your Repl.

**Step 3: Configure the Run Button**

- In the Replit workspace, click on the **"Shell"** tab next to the "Console".
- Type `npm install` and press **Enter** to install all the necessary dependencies.
- Once the installation is complete, click on the **"Run"** button at the top of the page to start the application.

**Step 4: View the Application**

- After clicking **"Run"**, Replit will start the server and the React application should compile.
- A new window labeled **"Output"** will appear showing your live application.
- Click on the **"Open in a new tab"** button in the top right corner of the Output window to view your Tic Tac Toe game in full screen.

## Playing the Game

Now that your application is running, you can play Tic Tac Toe directly in your browser. Enjoy the game!

### Install dependencies
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd your-repository-name
npm install react, socket.io, socket.io-client
```

Start the server
```bash
node backend/index.cjs
```

Run the React App
```bash
npm run dev
```


## Features
  - **Server connection**: Enhance your online gameplay to the next level using Socket.io.
  - **AI Opponent**: Sharpen your skills against a challenging AI.
  - **Stylish Canvas UI**: Enjoy a visually appealing game board.
  - **Learn React**: This is a basic yet perfect chance to start learning react game development.

# Backend Setup
The backend is built with Express and Socket.IO to handle real-time player login and logout.

```bash
// backend/index.cjs
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const { Server } = require('socket.io');
const cors = require('cors');

// ...rest of the backend code
```

# Frontend Components
## App Component
The App component initializes the game and displays a loading spinner before rendering the TicTacToe component.

```bash
// App.jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { ClipLoader } from 'react-spinners';
import TicTacToe from './TicTacToe';

// ...rest of the App component
```

## Canvas Component
The Canvas component is responsible for drawing the game board and handling user interactions.

```bash
// Canvas.jsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

// ...rest of the Canvas component
```

## TicTacToe Component
The TicTacToe component manages the game state and communicates with the backend server.

```bash
// TicTacToe.jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';
import Canvas from './Canvas';

// ...rest of the TicTacToe component
```

## Config files
  - **vite.config.js**: Configures Vite for the React app.
  - **tsconfig.json**: Sets up TypeScript options for the project.
