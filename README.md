## Features
  - **Server connection**: Enhance your online gameplay to the next level using Socket.io.
  - **AI Opponent**: Sharpen your skills against a challenging AI.
  - **Stylish Canvas UI**: Enjoy a visually appealing game board.
  - **Learn React**: This is a basic yet perfect chance to start learning react game development.

# Backend Setup
The backend is built with Express and Socket.IO to handle real-time player login and logout.

```bash
// backend/index.cjs
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const { Server } = require('socket.io');
const cors = require('cors');

// ...rest of the backend code
```

# Frontend Components
## App Component
The App component initializes the game and displays a loading spinner before rendering the TicTacToe component.

```bash
// App.jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { ClipLoader } from 'react-spinners';
import TicTacToe from './TicTacToe';

// ...rest of the App component
```

## Canvas Component
The Canvas component is responsible for drawing the game board and handling user interactions.

```bash
// Canvas.jsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

// ...rest of the Canvas component
```

## TicTacToe Component
The TicTacToe component manages the game state and communicates with the backend server.

```bash
// TicTacToe.jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';
import Canvas from './Canvas';

// ...rest of the TicTacToe component
```

## Config files
